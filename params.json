{"name":"mod_authnz_ibmdb2","tagline":"Apache authentication module for IBM DB2","body":"### Introduction\r\nmod_authn_ibmdb2 is an Apache authentication module using IBM® DB2® as the backend database for storing user and group information. The module supports several encryption methods.\r\n\r\nI also provide [UDFs and Stored Procedures](http://tessus.github.io/db2-hash-routines/) to generate and validate hashes in DB2. They are compatible to the functions that are used in Apache's htpasswd utility.\r\n\r\n**Note to Apache 1.x and 2.0.x users:**  \r\nActive development of [mod_auth_ibmdb2](https://github.com/tessus/mod_auth_ibmdb2) for Apache 1.x and 2.0.x has been stopped. \r\n\r\n### Features\r\n\r\n* runs under Apache 2.2.x and later (mod_authnz_ibmdb2)\r\n* runs under Apache 1.x and Apache 2.0.x (mod_auth_ibmdb2)\r\n* user authentication:\r\n  * bcrypt (APR-util ≥ 1.5.0)\r\n  * md5\r\n    * normal md5 hash (32 chars as in php)\r\n    * seeded md5 value (as generated with Apache's htpasswd utility or as in /etc/shadow)\r\n  * crypt\r\n  * sha1 (not available in mod_auth_ibmdb2 for Apache 1.x)\r\n  * sha256 (not available in mod_auth_ibmdb2)\r\n  * plain text\r\n  * no password (checks only if user exists)\r\n* if passwords are encrypted, the validation process checks the kind of encryption method\r\n* stored procedure support (not available in mod_auth_ibmdb2 for Apache 1.x)\r\n* support for user and group conditions (restricting result set of query)\r\n* caching support for users and groups\r\n* UDFs and SPs to generate and validate hashes in DB2\r\n* php scripts for importing users into DB2\r\n* man pages\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
